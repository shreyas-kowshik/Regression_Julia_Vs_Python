# Regression_Julia_Vs_Python
Implemented Linear Regression to study the time taken in both julia and python to reduce the loss to the same extent.

Julia takes approximately 5.62 seconds to get the loss down to 600 times of the initial loss.
Python brings it down to around 300 times and that too with 8.89 seconds.
